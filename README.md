# x86 MASM Wordle
A CLI-based Wordle game implemented with x86 MASM Assembly Language. Built using Kip Irvine's `Irvine32.inc` library. 
Follow these [instructions](https://www.asmirvine.com/gettingStartedVS2022/index.htm) to set up the required development environment to run the project.
## How To Play
First run the program in the required environment. You will then be prompted to choose either the single player or two player gamemode. If **single player** is selected you will be given siz attempts to guess the chosen word. If **two player** is selected a coin toss will initiate and the winner will guess first. After player one completes their round player two must guess their chosen word. The game is won by guessing your word in fewer tries than the other player. If there is a tie a coin is tossed determining the winner.
